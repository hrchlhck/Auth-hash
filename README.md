# Auth hash 
---
### Quick research about message digest 5 and authentication


- [x] Develop a software which implements a application that have two funcionalities: register and authenticate a user.
A user have the following attributes: name (four string character) and password (four string character). The registering should store data in a txt file. The application need to use MD5 algorithm to realize hash function for the password.

- [x] Search a code/algorithm of brute force for MD5 and process the file that contains the passwords early stored.
Compute the elapsed time for crack the passwords of four users. ~~I actually made one.~~

- [ ] Implement a solution to reduce the sucess of a brute force attack in the program early developed.
