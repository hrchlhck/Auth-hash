# Auth-hash
Quick research about message digest 5 and authentication

1. Develop a software which implements an application that have two funcionalities: register and authenticate a user. <br>
A user have the following attributes: name (four string character) and password (four string character). The registering should store data in a txt file. <br>
The application need to use MD5 algorithm to realize hash function for the password.

<p>
2. Search a code/algorithm of brute force for MD5 and process the file that contains the passwords early stored.
Compute the elapsed time for crack the passwords of four users. 
</p>

<p>
3. Implement a solution to reduce the sucess of a brute force attack in the program early developed.
